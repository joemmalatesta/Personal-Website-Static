            <h1 class="blog-title">Humble Beginnings</h1>
                <p class="blog-text">I've always had a love for computers, just in general. From a young age watching my dad troubleshoot Windows XP was fascinating to me. 
                    It is incredible to me that a couple of on and off switches inside of a box can put me online, playing an infinite block game at 120 frames per second. 
                    I've been able to navigate windows and do what I needed to as a user for as long as I can remember, but It wasn't until high school that I looked a little deeper.
                    In the 10th grade, a friend of mine introducted me to sneaker botting. I watched in awe as he bought up multiple $200 sweatshirts, that he then sold for $1200 each, all from his laptop at the lunchroom table. 
                    To me, it looked like free money just because he had some fancy software. 
                    Not only was it not free money, but even after a few months, I was still net negative.
                    This wouldn't be the case forever, though. After learning the ins and outs, the do's and dont's, and the rules of the game, 
                    I found myself in the most lucritive year of my life, getting my hands on multiple pairs of thousand dollar sneakers that I purchased for less than $200.
                    Not only were the shoes I sold expnesive, but the software I was using was even more so.</p>

                <h3 class="blog-header">Frame Shift</h3>
                <p class="blog-text">Then, that realization hit me. Sure I was making money selling shoes, but I was also paying monthly for software, sevrers, proxies, and information.
                    The software I had was limited, and each of every 750 users paid $50 a month to a presumed solo developer. 
                    I was making pennies in comparison to those supplying all of these things to me.
                    In the following year, I slowed down on buying these sneakers, and began networking with those supplying.
                    While my dreams remained in developing, my current knowledge only allowed for supplying information to others. 
                    With two others, I successfully opened a group full of information and resources to 200 people paying $25 a month. 
                    This went successfully for a few months but, most of my work being during school hours, I couldn't keep up and left the group.
                    I ended up selling my software and removing myself from the community, with a renewed aspiration of creating my own bot. </p>

                <p class="blog-text">From that time when I stopped in 2020, I began programming (initally slowly because I had little direction).
                    Over this past summer, I have finished two large projects that I had been anticipating since I began my programming journey, 
                    as well as beginning my first job supplying information to students, just as I had before.
                    In this coming school year I have lots of ideas I want to bring to life, and am excited to continue learning in school.
                     Perhaps, in this coming year, I will begin creating my own bot, slowly drawing the circle that will lead me back to my beginning.
