        I've always had an affinity for computers, just in general. From a young age, watching my dad troubleshoot Windows XP was fascinating to me
        and it's incredible that a couple of on and off switches inside of a box can put me online, playing an infinite block game at 144 frames per
        second. I've been able to navigate windows and do what I needed to as a user for as long as I can remember, but It wasn't until high school
        that I looked a little deeper. In the 10th grade, a friend of mine introduced me to sneaker botting. I watched in awe as he bought up multiple
        $200 sweatshirts, that he then sold for $1200 each, all from his laptop at the lunchroom table. Seeing this, I joined in and upon learning the
        ins and outs, the do's and don'ts, and the rules of the game, I found myself in the most lucrative year of my life. While the shoes I was
        selling were expensive, the software I was using was even more so.

        <!-- ONLY SHOWS ON SMALL SCREENS -->
        Sure I was making money selling shoes, but I was also paying monthly for software, servers, proxies, and information. The software I had was
        limited, and each of every 750 users paid $50 a month to a presumed solo developer. I was making pennies in comparison to those supplying all
        of these things to me. In the following year, I slowed down on buying these sneakers, and began networking with those supplying.

          width="400"
          style="float: left"
        />
        <!-- DOESN'T SHOW ON SMALL SCREENS -->
        While my dreams remained in developing, my current knowledge only allowed for supplying information to others. With two others, I successfully
        opened a group full of information and resources to 200 people paying $25 a month. This went successfully for a few months but, with most of
        my work being during school hours, I couldn't keep up and left the group. I ended up selling my software and removing myself from the
        community, with a renewed aspiration of creating my own software.

          width="400"
          style="float: right"
        />

        From that time when I stopped in 2020, I began learning how to code and, in doing so, found a new passion of mine. Over this past summer, I
        finished two large projects, broadly expanded my technical knowledge, and worked at my college teaching students how to code and supplying
        them information, just as I had before. In this coming school year I have lots of ideas I want to bring to life, and am excited to continue
        learning in school. Perhaps, in this coming year, I will begin creating my own bot, slowly drawing the circle that will lead me back to my
        beginning.
