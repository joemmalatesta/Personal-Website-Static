                    Since I started learning how to program, I never gave much thought to becoming a front-end developer, and 
                    I've never been overly creative or had a knack for design. Even with all of that in mind, I still decided against making this website using a 
                    template like Squarespace or WordPress. I opted to code it myself, figuring that I shouldn't write off front-end development if I had never 
                    at least tried it.

                <h1 class="blog-header">Na√Øve perception</h1>
                <p class="blog-text">Starting from scratch this summer, I taught myself HTML, CSS, and a little bit of PHP to finally bring my website to life.
                    While the result can be conveyed in a single sentence, the process cannot. I began with writing out, on paper, what content I wanted to have on my website
                    and how I wanted to lay it out. It is an understatement to say that what I initially imagined is nothing like how it came out.
                    I went through dozens of designs and ideas until I had it just right. That is, until I viewed it on my phone.
                    My site was exactly how I wanted it on my specific screen size but, with any other, all of the elements were misplaced and overlapped. 
                    This is when I sadly discovered website responsiveness.

                <h3 class="blog-header">A new approach</h3>
                <p class="blog-text">My next attempt was laying out a site for my desktop, and then using media queries to have a whole different site for my phone.
                    While this was sort of a fix, It was a lot of work to upkeep, was not maintainable, and didn't look perfect on medium screen sizes. 
                    I recalled hearing a popular framework called bootstrap that was responsive by design with little
                    work to be done to maintain that. So, after about a month of just finding the right tool, I got to work and ended with a website that I'm proud of,
                    a new found respect for front-end development, and lots of skills and knowledge I can use for future front-end battles.
