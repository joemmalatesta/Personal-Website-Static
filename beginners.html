                    While I'm not sure many people can confidently claim that title, being only two years into a computer 
                    science degree with no professional experience developing software, who was I to teach students about the concepts I was learning myself?

                <h3 class="blog-header">Task breakdown</h3>
                <p class="blog-text">In my job over the summer, I was given the opportunity to teach hundreds of students how to code on a week-over-week schedule.
                     Each week, a new group of students with varying levels of experience came, eager for an introduction to programming.
                      This schedule is what helped keep my job manageable. With 30 new students each week, mainly in middle and early high school,
                       it was fair to assume that few, if not any students had past experience with programming. It allowed my co-workers and me the 
                       opportunity to give these students a proper introduction. An introduction we all agreed we could have used ourselves.
                </p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-6 col-md">
                <h3 class="blog-header">Steps to success</h3>
                <p class="blog-text">My co-workers and I created beginner modules and games made in different programming languages that we would present
                     over the course of the week. We would split up the week teaching students Java, Python, HTML, CSS, and finally Lua in Roblox Studio.
                      In weeks leading up to starting the camps, we tried out our schedule, modules, and teaching methods with some co-workers that have never 
                      coded before, and received great feedback. So, when we finally brought this to our students, it's no wonder we got great reviews and even emails 
                      looking for more practice and resources.

                <h3 class="blog-header">Secret advantage</h3>
                <p class="blog-text">I thought it would be a hindrance to be as new to programming as I was when starting this job, 
                    but I quickly found that being a beginner myself, the adversity of starting my journey fresh in my mind was a huge advantage.
                     Giving these students an introduction into the field of computer science was an honor, and I am beyond grateful to be able to 
                     inspire a new generation that will lead the future of technology.
